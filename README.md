# Pulsechain : Just Another Ethereum Fork?

## Overview and Origin

#### Name of Company: [PulseChain](https://pulsechain.com/)
#### Founded: July 14, 2021
#### Founder: Richard Scheuler [Pseudonym : Richard Heart]
#### Motivation 
Addressing Ethereum's soaring fees and environmental implications, PulseChain emerges as an enhanced version. It stands as a testament to the belief that Proof of Stake chains can offer a more efficient and cleaner future compared to Proof of Work systems, and ecosystem can grow with each other.
#### Funding 
* PulseChain utilized a unique "sacrifice" funding approach, where users contributed various cryptocurrencies to an undisclosed wallet, backing their endorsement for a new system. Crucially, contributors had no expectations of returns, benefits, or any influence on the utilization of these funds. The initiative was a political statement of the belief and desire for change. 
* The total weight of individual sacrifices, in terms of amount and timing, was converted into point values, with participants able to track their rank on a leaderboard. The wallet impressively amassed approximately $670 million during its designated timeframe and more after the sacrifice was over; Following a predetermined bonding curve. The early phase of this period saw $1 equate to 10,000 points. However, over 14 days the rate adjusted to $2 for the same point value. Furthermore, a volume bonus, scaling from 1.00x to 2.50x, was granted based on rankings at the end of this 19-day period.
* This funding was kicked off with a Livestream from Richard Heart's Youtube channel, which fostered the Pulsechain Communtiy's vision.

## Business Activities

#### Competitive Advantage:
PulseChain boasts an improved block time, which is [17%](https://gopulse.com/blocks) faster than Ethereum, representing a significant leap in transaction efficiency.
#### Technologies Used:
    GoLang, a high-level programming language conceptualized at Google by Robert Griesemer.

## Domain Landscape

#### Industry: CryptoCurrency & Blockchain

#### Inovations: 
Over the past decade, the industry has witnessed a surge in forks, the rise of Layer 2 solutions, and a hyper growth of decentralized apps.

    Etheruem, Solana, Cardano, Tezos, Polkadot and Ripple.

## Results

### Impact
strategic airdrop for ERC-20 token holders, PulseChain has expanded its reach. Providing lower fees, it's attracting a segment of Ethereum' users, thereby easing network load.

### Performance Metrics: 
market cap and token price are important for gaguing performance. While PulseChain's currently stands at $0.0000593([.57x of Sacrifice](https://gopulse.com/)) there's room for growth, its trajectory suggests a potential resilient bottom then moving on to future gains.

## Recommendations

#### Proposal:
* Introducing an embedded wallet system within PulseChain could be a game-changer. A built-in wallet would serve as a fail safe, especially if third-party platforms like MetaMask impose connection restrictions.

#### Benefit: 
*  Ensuring connectivity to DApps and web3 platforms is essential. An built-in wallet can ensure uninterrupted transactions and interactions.

#### Techology use: 
* GoLang
#### Why:
Maintain System cohesion to ensure compability and stability.

## Conclusion

Pulsechain might be more than just an ethereum fork, though similar it represents a forward-thinking approach to ethereum and blockchain technology itself; inviting new developers and innovation. Ecosystem has much to mature but by addressing some of Ethereum's most pressing challenges, PulseChain is on the right track to carve a distinct identity in the ever-evolving crypto landscape.
